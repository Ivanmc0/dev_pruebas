                <p>Bootstrap’s grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content. It’s built with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes">flexbox</a> and is fully responsive. Below is an example and an in-depth look at how the grid comes together.</p>
                <p>While Bootstrap uses <code>em</code>s or <code>rem</code>s for defining most sizes, <code>px</code>s are used for grid breakpoints and container widths. This is because the viewport width is in pixels and does not change with the font size.</p>
